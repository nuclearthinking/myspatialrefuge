# comments

Review recent changes, look at code comments and validate that:

- does comment adds value into code, if not - remove it
- does comment can be simplified (condensed) into shorter sentence, while retaining its meaning and value
- does there need for additional commentary to explain non-obvious nuance of implementation
- keep lua typehint commentaries
