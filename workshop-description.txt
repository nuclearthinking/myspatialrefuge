[h1]My Spatial Refuge[/h1]

Escape the apocalypse to your own personal, upgradeable spatial refuge! Build your ultimate survival space using Zombie Cores.

[h2]Update 1.8 — Refuge Inheritance (Singleplayer)[/h2]
[b]Your refuge persists through death![/b] In singleplayer, if your character dies and you create a new character in the same world (via death screen), your new character will automatically inherit the previous character's refuge — including all upgrades, tier level, and stored items.

[i]Note: This only works within the same game world. Starting a new game creates a fresh refuge.[/i]

[h2]Update 1.6 — New Refuge Upgrade System[/h2]
[b]Big changes are here, and more are coming.[/b] Spatial Refuge is an unknown entity that entered the world alongside the Knox Virus. Its intentions are unclear — it cannot speak like people do — but it offers survivors a safe shelter and strange opportunities to grow.

In exchange for knowledge of your world, the Spatial Refuge offers new ways to improve your refuge and gain unique bonuses while inside.

[h2]Multiplayer & Co-op Ready[/h2]
[b]Full multiplayer and co-op support![/b] Each player gets their own private refuge that persists across sessions.
